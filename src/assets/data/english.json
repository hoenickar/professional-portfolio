Mobile apps are included, which allow for the optimization of response times within a company. These apps are modular, with the possibility of acquiring modules as needs arise, and an integrated e-commerce store with B2C, B2B, and Mercado Libre I collaborate with my team on the client side using the PrimeNg library, Angular, and its workspace packages. Together with my team, we implement lazy loading and modularization in the project. On my part, I refactored template-driven form components, migrating them to reactive forms in different modules of the application. I customized methods that allow for printing PrimeNg tables in Excel and PDF formats, as well as methods to load all the necessary endpoint data for each component Currently, I'm implementing improvements and solutions to the various problems that arise in different modules during application development. We use the MantisBT software to effectively manage tasks with my team"
